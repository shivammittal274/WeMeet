WeMeet, A Video Conferencing platform built in the Microsoft Engage Program 2021 with the help of Microsoft mentors. Through this app, multiple users can join the meeting and continue their video/audio conversation and feel like they are connected close yet far.


Technologies Used:
React
Node
Express
WebRTC
Firebase
MongoDb
Material UI etc.

Features of WeMeet (Done):
1. Register/Login
2. Audio/ Video Call
3. Screen share
4. Chat room
5. Share Files/Emoji
6. Auto Subtitles Generation
7. Collaborative Whiteboard
8. Add some Notes
9. Block abusive Messages in Chat room
10. Record Meeting


As there was less time for this to build/add more features, I would surely try to add more features later. Some good additional features I thought:
1. Remote PC control
2. Add Background
3. Send messages individually
4. Screen Annotations
5. Calendar of Upcoming Meetings
6. Extra rooms in same meeting
7. Auto Mail Summary of Meeting to non attendees
8. Super Resolution
9. Denoising Video
10. Host having right to mute/kick participants

These features are very good to be in a video calling app. So, others, if you like my project, please contribute to this project. Would be very happy to continue building such a major open source project.


If you are having any queries regarding this project, You can mail me Shivam Mittal Would be very happy to help out.

Thanks
